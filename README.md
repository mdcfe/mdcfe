### 👋 Hey, I'm MD! I work on a few open-source projects, mostly related to Minecraft: Java Edition.

I'm a lead maintainer of [EssentialsX/Essentials](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials). I've also made some other things:
- [**Minecraft Changelog Viewer**](https://mdcfe.dev/mc-changes): View recent changelogs for Minecraft: Java Edition.
- [**Spigot Drama Generator**](https://drama.essentialsx.net/): Generate some drama about the Minecraft server community. 
- [**Disable Player Reporting**](https://modrinth.com/mod/disable-player-reporting): A Fabric mod that "removes" the Player Reporting feature from Minecraft 1.19.1+.

❤ If you want to support my work, you can do so over at [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/mdcfe/).

#### Getting in touch

I'm part of the [Minecraft Open Source Software](https://discord.gg/h8CnPSw) community on Discord. You can reach me at `@mdcfe#1970` on there.

> Please don't send friend requests or DMs without getting in touch first! I often can't help with the projects I work on in DMs.
